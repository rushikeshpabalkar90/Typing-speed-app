                    "control allows certain parts of code to execute if the conditions are right. This flow control "
                    "is done by using statements and code blocks. The most common and widely used statement is the if "
                    "statement. It will compute if a statement is true or false. If it's true, it will execute the "
                    "code. If it's false, it won't execute the code. 1234",

    "for_statement": "The way for is used in Python and C-based languages differs significantly. Since Python's for "
                     "statement is iterator-based, how would we have the temporary variable hold a number that "
                     "increments on every loop? You could make a large tuple to hold each number, but this would "
                     "waste a lot of memory and time. The built-in function range function can help us here. This "
                     "function creates an iterator list of numbers, without all the typing or memory waste. There's "
                     "an example below demonstrating the uses of range function. 45467",
